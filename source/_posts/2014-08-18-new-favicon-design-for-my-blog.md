To ㊗️ my wife passed driver license theory course, I created a new log for my blog 😝

Here is what I got:

{% asset_img logo.png Logo for ThoughtWorkshop %}

## Gear

`Gear` is the hint of workshop. Because this blog is named as `TimNew's ThoughtWorkshop`

In the beginning, I was intend to create the gear in [Steampunk style]. I like such old-fashioned style, but later I found such style is not distinguishable in small icon, so I simplified it to the dark-metel gear.

## D

Letter `D` is from the pronunciation of my Chinese name, which might not be well-known. It is a personal logo, so I wish to have something personal in it.

The font is `Gear Box` from [Gaut Fonts].

It is an awesome font to create some mechanical feel design.

The rainbow color is the hint of unrestrained idea and inspiration. In Chinese, it reads 天 🌌 马 🐎 行 ✈️ 空 🚀 不 🚫 靠 🎵 谱.

Well, this is it.
