[Atom] is general purpose text editor brought to us by GitHub guys, which is empowered by the loved `Node.js` and `Chrome`.

Someone said `Atom` is just another clone of [Sublime]. Well, I don't quite agree with the saying. I'd like to say `Atom` learnt a lot from `Sublime`.
And I'd like to explain why.

I think `Sublime` itself is a great text editor, powerful to use, easy to learn, ready to be hacked, matured community, tons of plug-ins... almost unlimited possibilities...

But on the other hand, I think, `Sublime` is too sticky to "Text". Yes, it is a text editor, but it doesn't mean everything in the editor could only be text-based.
Implementing custom UI in `Sublime` isn't a easy job to do. Benefits from HTML based technologies, `Atom` has a lot more rich features, CSS3 effects, CSS3 Animations, SVG, and a lot more...

Along with [Brackets], [C9], `Atom` is the important candidates of next-gen editors. But among them, only `Atom` is a general purpose editor.

Since `Atom` is still in the eary stage, there are a number of flaws and issues in it. Besides these bugs, the biggest problem of `Atom` is performance.
Loading a several MB text file or thousands pages document will kill the editor in no time.

But still, these issues won't block me from loving it. As a `node.js` and `Ruby` developer, it is an awesome companion to my work. {% emoji heart %}
