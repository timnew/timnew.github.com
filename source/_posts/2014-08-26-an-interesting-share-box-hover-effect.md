Today I spent some time on customizing the share-box used in this blog.

Here is the effect

{% codepen timnew AweKi 7928 result 257 %}

The cover effect for the social network icons are simulate the icon is floating from the background by animating the shadow. In the implementation, I used some shadow described in [Material Design Shadow in HTML]. For the texts, I use the `text-shadow` effect that used on the same text shadow used on tht title of the article.
